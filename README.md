# HappyDayDessert

## About

In the Spring of 2023, I developed a front-end static webpage for Happy Day Dessert Factory, a local ice cream shop in Pittsburgh. The main goal of this project was to enhance the user experience, making it friendlier and more engaging compared to the existing website.

## About my implementation

- **Built from Scratch:** Utilized HTML/CSS and JavaScript libraries (jQuery, AOS) to create the website.
- **Wireframing:** Designed the layout and interface of the website using Figma.
- **User Testing:** Conducted thorough user testing to optimize the user experience (UX) for all intended users.
